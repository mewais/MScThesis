\chapter{Lay Summary}
Today's computer systems have two main elements: processors to do the computations, and memories to hold the data. However, memories that are large enough for today's applications can be a lot slower than processors, limiting their speed. A work around is to use smaller and faster memories placed in between the processor and the memory, called caches, that can only hold the critical data needed by the processor. A bigger cache means more critical data can be accessed at high speed, but it also makes the cache slower. This work combines and builds upon previous data compression techniques to allow the caches to store more data without increasing the physical cache size, giving the benefits of a bigger cache while maintaining the same speed.
