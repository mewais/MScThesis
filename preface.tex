\chapter{Preface}

This dissertation is based on joint work done by PhD student Amin Ghasemazar and myself in the same research group. None of the text of the dissertation is taken directly from previously published or collaborative articles.\par
Amin and myself worked on the idea and design together. We both independently implemented the BDI, Dedup, and straightforward DedupBDI caches in Chapters~\ref{ch:BackgroundMotiv} and~\ref{ch:Design}. We individually worked on verifying our own implementations then together worked on cross verification of both implementations.
The offline analysis done in Chapter~\ref{ch:BackgroundMotiv}, the experiments done in Sections~\ref{sec:Upper Bound} and~\ref{sec:Final Implementation}, the ideal and final cache implementations in \ref{sec:Upper Bound} and \ref{sec:Final Implementation}, the area and power estimations done in Section~\ref{sec:areapower}, and gathering the final results reported in this work were done by me.
